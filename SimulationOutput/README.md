Here March28_eig corresponds to the SLM (state level modelling) approach to setting initial conditions, while March28_sim corresponds to the CSM (county simulation method) simulations.

Within each folder there are 8 scenarios. Social_X corresponds to baseline simulations where X=1 has no effects of social distancing, X=2 is a 25% reduction in transmission rates via social distancing, X=3 is a 50% reduction and X=4 is a 75% reduction. Scenarios of the form Social_Xrelaxed model a scenario in which social distancing policies are relaxed back to business as usual on May 15, 2020.
